This project was created as part of a introduction to programming lecture. The code is for a wine recommendation web application that aims to help users find new wines based on their preferences and interests. The application offers various options to cater to different user requirements. Options A to D are designed for users looking to discover new wines, while Option E is intended for those who want to check the rating of a specific wine.

The application uses a dataset containing wine information, such as price, country, and variety. The data is cleaned and processed to ensure only relevant information is used in generating recommendations. The application is built with the Streamlit framework, allowing for a user-friendly and interactive web interface.

Option A offers random wine recommendations for users who are open to trying new wines. These recommendations are selected from the top 25% of the wines according to their rating (with a minimum of 91 points).

Option B allows users to get recommendations based on their preferred price range in Euros, while Option C offers recommendations based on the user's chosen country.

Option D caters to users looking for a more personalized experience by allowing them to filter recommendations by price, country, and variety.

Lastly, Option E is designed for users who are in a store and want to get the rating of a specific wine. They can enter the wine's name or keyword, and the application will display the relevant information.

Overall, this wine recommendation web application offers a versatile and user-friendly experience for wine enthusiasts looking to discover new wines or gain more information about a specific wine.
